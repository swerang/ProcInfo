# ProcInfo

This simple QT Quick application will display CPU information from /proc/cpuinfo by dynamically loading a new tab to display each processor's information in /proc/cpuinfo. A screenshot of the application's output is included in this project. Although I have only worked with QT Widgets in the past, this is my sincere attempt to apply QT Quick/QML concepts for this problem.
